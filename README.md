# Neural-Network-Implementation-in-Java-

**Introduction:**
This repository contains an implementation of a simple neural network designed to classify boolean gates. Built entirely using Java, it showcases how one can leverage traditional programming languages to dive into the fascinating world of neural computations and artificial intelligence.

**Main Features:**

**1**: Forward Propagation Algorithm: At the heart of our neural network, the forward propagation algorithm enables efficient computation of the network's predictions, making it apt for the binary nature of boolean gates.

**2**: Recursive Network Design: A standout feature of this neural network is its recursive design. By using the output of one layer as the input for the next, the network can learn intricate patterns and relationships in the input data.

**Use-Cases:**
Ideal for educational demonstrations and for those looking to get started with neural networks in Java. This repository bridges the gap between traditional programming paradigms and the evolving field of machine learning.

**Getting Started:**
Clone the repository and follow the setup instructions in the README. With a few simple steps, you can have the neural network up and running, ready to classify boolean gates!
